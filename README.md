<h1>GAME OBJECTVE:</h1>

The primary goal of the Halloween Hangman Game, "Ghost in the Machine: A Halloween Hangman for Devs", is to engage players in a fun and challenging word-guessing experience with a Halloween theme, and the questions are focused on the topic of software engineering.
The game objective is pretty straightforward, which is to guess the hidden word based on the provided hints before making six incorrect guesses, which would lead the player to a game over.
