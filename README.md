<h4>üéØGAME OBJECTIVE: </h4>
The primary goal of the Halloween Hangman Game, "Ghost in the Machine: A Halloween Hangman for Devs", is to engage players in a fun and challenging word-guessing experience with a Halloween theme, and the questions are focused on the topic of software engineering. The game objective is pretty straightforward; the player must rely on the hints provided and guess the hidden word before making six incorrect guesses, which would lead the player to a game over.
<h4>üì¢RULES: </h4>
The rules of the game are as follows:

a.) The game revolves around guessing a hidden word based on provided hints.

b.) Players are allowed a maximum of six incorrect guesses before the game ends.

c.) Each incorrect guess reveals a part of a hangman figure on the screen.

d.) If the player accumulates six incorrect guesses, the complete hangman is displayed, resulting in a game over.

e.) To win, the player must successfully guess the word by making all the correct guesses.

<h2>üíªTECHNOLOGY STACK USED: </h2>

The Halloween Hangman Game uses a captivating technology stack, with HTML and CSS playing instrumental roles alongside Javascript. 

a.) HTML: Expanded as Hyper Text Markup Language It establishes the structural aspect of the game with organized content. It organizes the game's user interface, which includes text, buttons, and containers. It also makes sure that players can navigate through the game environment. HTML also allows browser compatibility, which ensures that players can access the game across diverse platforms and devices. 

b.) CSS: Expanded as Cascading Style Sheets CSS imparts a layer that ensures a visually appealing and responsive design, which puts the players in the atmosphere of Halloween. CSS is involved in everything from the choice of background images to font styles, animations, and button designs, which gives the game a thematic and visually enchanting design.

c.) JavaScript: Javascript plays a pivotal role in creating a dynamic and engaging user experience. It takes care of the game mechanics, such as choosing the words for the players to guess, keeping track of correct and incorrect guessing, and revealing the hangman figure for each mistake accumulated. Javascript is also responsible for determining the game outcomes, whether the player has successfully guessed the word or accumulated incorrect guesses, and creating a dynamic countdown timer for a page (this enhances the user experience and sense of anticipation). Event handlers are the driving force behind the user interactions and game-flow of the Halloween Hangman game.

The combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript provides an unforgettable gaming experience. This shows the dynamic capabilities of this trio, which shows how they work together to build an engaging and appealing Halloween-themed Hangman game
